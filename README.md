# KQ-Wabba_Recreation
Lua files only of my Wabbajack recreation made in Roblox.

A recreation of the "Wabbajack" staff found in TES V: Skyrim. Using the staff produces numerous effects such as damaging, transforming, or teleporting players. All Lua code is custom. The Wabbajack model and textures, and any other models or textures that this project used are not up for redistribution, and I claim no rights over them. This project was mostly for learning and fun purposes, as the Wabbajack is my favourite magical weapon in Skyrim.

This project was also co-authored by my friend known as "aaaddd" on Roblox.com. He helped me with the actual projectile and tool logic, while I re-created the tools effects. 

PLEASE NOTE: This repo does not contain all of the required files for this project. None of these files will work without multiple other files and systems inside a Roblox experience. This repo is purely for portfolio/demonstration purposes.
